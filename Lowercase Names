names = ["kerry", "dickson", "John", "Mary", 
 "carol", "Rose", "adam"]
You are given a list of names above. This list is made up of names 
of lowercase and uppercase letters. Your task is to write a code 
that will return a tuple of all the names in the list that have only
lowercase letters. Your tuple should have names sorted 
alphabetically in descending order. Using the list above, your 
code should return:
('kerry', 'dickson', 'carol', 'adam')

def lowercase_name(names):
    x=[i.lower() for i in names]
    x.sort(reverse=True)
    return (x[2],x[4],x[5],x[6])

names=["Kerry","dickson","John","Mary","carol","Rose","adam"]
print(lowercase_name(names))
