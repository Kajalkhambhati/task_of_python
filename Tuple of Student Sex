You work for a school and your boss wants to know how many 
female and male students are enrolled in the school. The school
has saved the students in a list. Your task is to write a code that 
will count how many males and females are in the list. Here is a 
list below:
students = ['Male', 'Female', 'female', 'male', 'male', 'male',
 'female', 'male', 'Female', 'Male', 'Female', 'Male', 'female']
Your code should return a list of tuples. The list above should 
return:
[(‘Male’,7), (‘female’,6)]

def student_gender(list1):
    count=0
    x=list1.count("Male")+list1.count("male")     
    y=list1.count("female")+list1.count("Female")
    return  [("Male",x),("Female",y)]   

list1=['Male', 'Female', 'female', 'male', 'male', 'male',
 'female', 'male', 'Female', 'Male', 'Female', 'Male', 'female']
print(student_gender(list1))
