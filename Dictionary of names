You are given a list of names, and you are asked to write a code that returns all the names that start with ‘S’. Your code should 
return a dictionary of all the names that start with S and how many times they appear in the dictionary. Here is a list below:
names = ["Joseph","Nathan", "Sasha", "Kelly", "Muhammad", "Jabulani", "Sera”, "Patel", "Sera”]
Your code should return: {“Sasha”: 1, “Sera”: 2}

def Dictionary_of_names(names):
    d={}
    for i in names:
        if i.startswith("S"):
            if i in d:
                d[i]+=1
            else:
                d[i]=1
    return d

Name=["Joseph","Nathan","Sasha","Kelly","Muhammad","Jabulani","Sera","patel","Sera","Sera"]
print(Dictionary_of_names(Name))
