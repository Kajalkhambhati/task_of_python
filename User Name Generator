Write a function called user_name that generates a username from the userâ€™s email. The code should ask the user to input an email and the code should return everything before the @ sign 
as their user name. For example, if someone enters ben@gmail.com, the code should return ben as their user name.

def user_name(str1):#define function
    x=str1.index("@")#save index of @ in variable
    return str1[0:x]#return string before @
print(user_name("ben@gmail.com")) #call the function
